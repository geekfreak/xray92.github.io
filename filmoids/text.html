<a name="description"></a><p><b><i>Filmoids</i></b> is a desktop video system; which has been developed for the Macintosh platform to run with Quicktime 4.0 +.<br>
</p>
<p><b><i>Filmoids</i></b> links experimental film, digital art, and biological science by mapping digital film clips to a psuedo genome and then breeding them together to create illustrious offspring.<br>
</p>
<p><b><i>Filmoids</i></b> explores an alternative method of engaging the computer in digital filmmaking, which has evolved 
as a distinctive art form with its own rules and language - very different 
from its analog video and film predecessors. We have already seen new digital 
film genres emerging such as interactive movies, pixel vision, video conferencing, 
web cams and streaming video. As bandwidth increases and the Internet becomes 
a viable distribution method, many more possibilities exist to explore the inherent 
structure and aesthetics of digital video.</p>
<p><b><i>Filmoids</i></b> uses the metaphor of digital films being something organic, a form 
  grown in the computer space. The digital film forms have an underlying artificial 
  life algorithm, fluid and autonomous, a kind of &quot;control without control&quot;. 
  In this model the digital film is self-directed, and the filmmaking hierarchy 
  of director, producer, editor do not exist. This system acts as a commentary 
  on filmmaking and its inherent notions of narrative and directorial authorship.</p>

<p>
<b>The Process</b>
<br>The digital film clips must be mapped to a pseudo genome using Video Genome Builder and then bred together in Video Genome Breeder to create offspring.</p>

<p><b><i>Mapping the pseudo genome</i></b><br>
Video Genome Builder uses the widely known example of cellular automata " Conway's Game of Life", in order to "characterize" a digital film clip. It then embeds the characterization in the clip as a pseudo genome. Once the user has processed a digital film clip through this software, the clip will then have its own genetic code embedded within the digital film file. The software uses the Quicktime® file format, which has the ability to store this extra data. You can access the pseudo genome via the Quicktime Application Programming Interface®, which is visible as a property of the movie in the Quicktime player.</p>

<p><b><i>Breeding the Filmoids</i></b><br>
Video Genome Breeder enables you to breed together two parent films, which have been encoded by the pseudo genome. The user can specify breeding and mutation settings. Each generation of the breed cycle allows you to preview from a selection of four "child" films, which can be rendered in the Quicktime® format.
During the breeding process both the digital film and the pseudo gene may mutate. The style and frequency of these mutations can be controlled by interaction with the software. As each generation mutates it increases the entropy (or disorder) within the system. It is the users responsibility to manage the level of entropy in the system, and the software provides an interface for doing so.</p>

<p>
Geneticists have demonstrated that heritability in biology is made possible by the encoding of the structural information in the DNA and that variability is a consequence of recombination and mutation in that DNA. DNA can be considered as a set of instructions on how to make a body, written in the ATCG alphabet of nucleotides. The Filmoids system uses Video Genome Builder to encode the ATCG nucleotides within the digital film files, and the resulting genetic material is used as instructions for breeding the digital film forms in Video Genome Breeder.</p>
<p>
All organisms have a genotype and a phenotype. The genotype can be defined as the specific versions of the genes at specific loci in an individual's genetic make-up. Video Genome builder has its genotype located within the digital film clips specified by the number of keyframes. The keyframe number instructs the software to split the digital film file into a specific number of sections so that each section is represented by a single piece of genetic material. Mutations are introduced at this point according to the rules configured to generate difference, and the user selects which child film to render into a new digital film form. The phenotype can be defined as the visible properties of an organism that are produced by the interaction of this genotype and the environment, i.e., the digital film forms. In this sense, Filmoids functions as an evolutionary mechanism through which reproduction, genome variation and natural selection of digital film forms becomes possible.</P>
