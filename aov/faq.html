<b>Q.</b><i><b> If I see artwork that interests me on the ARTWORK ON VIEW website, how can I find out more about the artwork of the artist?</b></i><br>



<b>A.</b> The AOV website provides you with current information on exhibits of each participating artist so that you can visit their exhibits in the area in which you live or are vacationing.  AOV also sets out all the information you need to make direct contact with an artist so that you can talk to the artist and view artwork which may not otherwise be available for exhibition. You can plan an art-viewing itinerary by using the AOV website to locate participating artists in a specific area.  This is one of the unique aspects of AOV.<br>

 </p>

 <p> 

<b>Q.</b><i><b> How do I search for a specific artist or artwork in a particular medium on the ARTWORK ON VIEW website?</b></i><br>

 

<b>A.</b> If you already know the artist's name, click on "Artists" and an alphabetical listing of participating artists will appear.  You can then select the artist in whom you are interested and view his or her work at your leisure.  If you are interested in work in a particular medium, viewing that artwork is equally easy.  Simply click on the medium and a variety of artwork in that medium originating with different participating artists will appear.  The thumbnail depictions help you determine whether you are interested in seeing further work in that medium by the identified artist.  You can then select the specific artist whose work in that medium particularly interests you for further viewing. The geographic location of all participating artists is provided.<br>

 </p>

 <p>

<b>Q.</b><i><b> How is the ARTWORK ON VIEW website different from commercial websites, which sell artwork?</b></i><br>

 

<b>A.</b> ARTWORK ON VIEW is a non-profit art organization, which seeks to connect artists and art lovers and to make the purchase of contemporary artwork affordable. Commercial websites, which sell artwork, exact a commission on all artwork sales affected through the website. These commissions inevitably increase the price of contemporary artwork and make it less accessible to the public. AOV does not exact sales commission from its artists.<br>

 <b>Q.</b><i><b> What are the advantages of exhibiting my artwork on the ARTWORK ON VIEW website?</b></i><br>

 

<b>A.</b> The AOV website, which features educational presentations on varying aspects of today’s visual arts, exhibits your work and announces your current shows to an enormous number of website users.  The website is aggressively promoted and is linked to all major search engines so that your work receives broader exposure than is possible with individual websites. Yet, unlike commercial online galleries, AOV charges no commission on any purchase by an AOV website user who was led to contact you by the website.

<br>

 </p>

 <p>

<b>Q.</b><i><b> How can I apply to exhibit my artwork on the ARTWORK ON VIEW website?</b></i><br>

 

<b>A.</b> Contact AOV by mail, phone, fax or e-mail. A copy of the AOV application form is accessible on this website. Do not send money.

 </p>

 <p>

<b>Q.</b><i><b> What does ARTWORK ON VIEW charge to exhibit my artwork on its website?</b></i><br>

 

<b>A.</b> If your application is accepted, AOV charges $48.00 per year.  This amount does not cover the costs of showing your work, maintaining current announcements of your exhibitions, promoting the web site and producing educational art programs.  The balance of AOV’s costs and expenses are covered by voluntary contributions and grants. You are charged nothing more.<br>

 </p>

 <p>

<b>Q.</b><i><b> What are my continuing obligations when Artwork on View exhibits my artwork?</b></i><br>

 

<b>A.</b> None. You pay a minimum annual fee to partially offset AOV’s expenses. There are no hidden charges.<br>  

 </p>

 <p>

<b>Q.</b><i><b> My artwork is already exhibited on another website.  Can my artwork be shown on the Artwork on View website?</b></i><br>

 

<b>A.</b> Yes, unless your agreement with that other website explicitly prohibits you from showing on another art website or indicates that the website is your exclusive representative as an artist.<br>

 </p>

 <p>

<b>Q.</b><i><b> I maintain my own website to promote my work.  Does that create any problem in showing my artwork on the Artwork on View website?</b></i><br>

 

<b>A.</b> No, your own website does not create a problem.  To the contrary, the AOV website will identify your website so that interested users can view additional samples of your work.  Maintaining your own website is not necessary to benefit from the AOV website.  However, if you do have a functioning website displaying your work it can be helpful.<br>
