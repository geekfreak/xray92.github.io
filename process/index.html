  The Interactive Educational Technology department of SFMOMA released an award winning online educational program <a href="http://www.sfmoma.org/msoma/" target="_blank">&ldquo;Making Sense of Modern Art&rdquo;</a> in late 2000. The Curriculum Prototype was developed to test the concept of developing online high school curriculum utilizing flash based learning modules taken from the &ldquo;Making Sense of Modern Art&rdquo; (MSOMA) program.</p>

      <p><strong>First Steps</strong><br>
  My first step in this project was to become familiar with the flash based MSOMA modules and to understand how the subject matter experts had developed curriculum content around these modules. I achieved this by quickly creating an HTML prototype, this first iteration was presented to a user group for feedback. After many design and evaluation sessions with senior interactive producers, educators and museum curators, a functional requirements document was created based on the user groups recommendations. We then began to work on the second iteration of the prototype. </p>

      <p><strong>Challenges<br>
      </strong>These were the main challenges for v2.0: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Content should be organized by theme, rather than by activity. This prototype will include only two themes, &quot;Art and Social Change&quot; and &quot;Artists as Rule Breakers&quot;. Each theme will contain the high-level activites of &quot;Looking Closely at Art&quot; and &quot;Thinking and Producing&quot;.&quot; Analyzing Multiple Perspectives&quot; will be added later. </li>
        <li>Structure needs to be expandable as eventually there will be ten themes.</li>
        <li>To meet Californian teaching standards content should also be categorized within the three disciplines of Language Arts, Visual Arts and History/Social Studies. </li>
        <li>Students require access to flash based learning objects and curriculum activity questions simultaneously. </li>
        <li>All actvities need to have a print option for classroom use. </li>
        <li>Site should be split into two parts, one part for the teacher and one part for the student.</li>
        <li> Student activity materials should be  accesible from the teacher section, allowing teachers to easily model their curriculum.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><img src="images/rule_1.gif" width="600" height="1"></p>
  <p><strong>Solution</strong><br>
      Due to the vast amount of information I firstly created a detailed content inventory which would also help keep track of all the assets. From this preliminary outline I  created the sitemap.</p>

    </tr>
  </table>
 
      <p>Next I began together with the senior producer and subject matter expert to define the navigational structure. During this process we twice went back to our user group for feedback. One of the major problems we were facing was the need to organize the content both by discipline and theme. We initially used the three disciplines as an entry point but the high school teachers in our user group showed a strong preference for having theme at the top level. The final iteration has theme at the top level, and we organized the content within &quot;Thinking and Producing&quot; by discipline. &quot;Looking Closely&quot; is a more general point of entry, facilitating a more &quot;click and discover&quot; usage.</p>

      <p> Our final prototype was a web interface which conained both the flash based learning modules and curriculum content within one window. The flash learning modules consistently load in a central window, all navigation elements are contained within collapsible menus in the left hand bar. A breadcrumb trail acts both as an orientation device and a &quot;back button&quot;. &quot;Explore&quot; questions always appear underneath their corresponding flash learning modules in the lower part of the screen. This structure creates a concrete link between the flash modules and their related curriculum activities. All activities can be viewed on screen or printed as a PDF file. The teacher's version of the site mirrors the student version but also allows the teachers easy access to teaching standards and rationale. </p>
      <p><img src="images/rule_1.gif" width="600" height="1"></p>
      <p> <strong> Outcome<br>
      </strong>High school teachers create their own lesson worksheets which guide the students to the acitivities they wish them to complete. High school students and teachers tested the MSOMA Curriculum Site in the classroom. Six schools were chosen in San Francisco and Marin County, which would encompass as diverse and wide a range of students and classroom based teaching methods as possible. </p>

      <p><strong>Role<br>
      </strong>Information architecture, navigational models and flows. Development of a prototype using HTML, CSS, DHTML, Javascript and Flash. I also created HTML templates to allow SME's to complete text editing independently. User testing in High Schools.</p>
